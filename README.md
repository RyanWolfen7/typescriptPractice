## Privitar App

This is my Submission for Privitar. It is my first time using typescript so I'm pretty excited to see how it turns out. 
As of now the mobile version does not have all the features of the web browser. It looks ok on most devices.

## To start

Clone this Repo

    git pull https://github.com/RyanWolfen7/typescriptPractice.git

Go into the directory

    cd typescriptPractice

Install the packages

    npm install

Create a .env File

    touch .env

Create the api key for the client

    echo "REACT_APP_API_KEY=ooooooYOUR_KEY_HEREoooooooo" > .env

Start the App

    npm start

Optional Run Cypress

    npm run cypress:open


### Wanted goal

I did not complete the task within the alloted time, if I would continue on this app i would add a few more features;
- Validation on the New person field
- Style Animations and better transitions
- Implimented a redux or state fetching resource
- Cleaned up the mobile view 

### Tech Used
Node, React, Typescript, Cypress,
